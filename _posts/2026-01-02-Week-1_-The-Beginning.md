   <img src="/assets/images/week-1.jpg" alt="Picture of the Week" width="400">*Heres the book! I just bought it hehe*

## What I Learnt This Week

- **Multi-Dimensional Prefix Sums:** Prefix sum i column, then pref j column.. or how many dimensions are there, if you would like to get the prefix sum of a specific rectangle then you can use the inclusion exclusion formula from Set Theory.
$$
\sum_{i=a}^{A} \sum_{j=b}^{B} \text{arr}[i][j] = \text{prefix}[A][B] - \text{prefix}[a-1][B] - \text{prefix}[A][b-1] + \text{prefix}[a-1][b-1]
$$
